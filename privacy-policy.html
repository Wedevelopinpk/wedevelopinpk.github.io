      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how WeDevelopInPK (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles information within our Android apps:
        <strong>Medical DICOM Viewer</strong> and <strong>DataVault: Photo &amp; Video Vault</strong>. 
        We value your trust and are committed to transparency, user control, and security.</p>

      <hr style="border-color:#444; margin:30px 0;">

      <h3>🩻 Medical DICOM Viewer</h3>
      <p>The Medical DICOM Viewer is designed to help users view and manage DICOM images efficiently while ensuring privacy and security.</p>

      <p><strong>🚫 No Personal Data Collection:</strong> The app does not collect, store, or transmit personal or medical data to our servers. 
      DICOM files remain entirely local to your device unless you manually upload them using integrated cloud services.</p>

      <p><strong>📁 Local File Access:</strong> The app requests storage permission only to open DICOM images or ZIP archives you select. 
      These files are processed locally, never transmitted externally, and deleted automatically from cache when closed.</p>

      <p><strong>☁️ Google Drive Integration:</strong>
        <br>- <strong>Authentication:</strong> Securely handled via Google Sign-In. Only limited basic info (like your email) is shown in-app and not stored.
        <br>- <strong>Permissions:</strong> The app requests <code>DriveScopes.DRIVE_READONLY</code> — meaning it can view and download, but never modify or delete your files.
        <br>- <strong>Temporary Files:</strong> Any downloaded files are cached in a secure private folder and auto-deleted after use.
      </p>

      <p><strong>💳 Google Play Billing:</strong> Used for one-time Pro upgrades. Payments are processed entirely by Google Play; we never see or store your payment details.</p>

      <p><strong>📊 Ads and Data Sharing:</strong> This app displays ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. 
      AdMob may collect <em>approximate location, device or other IDs, and app interaction data</em> for ad personalization, analytics, and fraud prevention. 
      For more details, review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>🔐 Security:</strong> All data and communications are encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS. 
      The app does not store sensitive credentials on any server.</p>

      <p><strong>🧾 Policy Updates:</strong> Updates will be posted here. Continued use means you agree to the updated policy.</p>

      <hr style="border-color:#444; margin:40px 0;">

      <h3>🧱 DataVault: Photo &amp; Video Vault</h3>
      <p><strong>DataVault</strong> provides a secure space to protect your private photos, videos, and files. 
      It operates fully offline unless you choose to use optional cloud features.</p>

      <p><strong>🛡️ No Personal Tracking:</strong> DataVault does not collect analytics or personally identifying data. 
      However, the free version displays ads via <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, which may collect non-personal identifiers for ad delivery and performance monitoring.</p>

      <p><strong>📂 Local Storage &amp; Encryption:</strong> 
      Files remain encrypted locally with AES-256 or Google Tink Streaming AEAD (AES256-GCM-HKDF-4KB). 
      Files smaller than 5MB (such as photos) use direct AES-256-GCM encryption; larger files (videos or archives) use streaming encryption for performance. 
      Encryption and decryption occur entirely on your device.</p>

      <p><strong>☁️ Optional Cloud Backup:</strong> 
      If you enable cloud sync (Google Drive, Dropbox, or WebDAV), files are encrypted before upload. 
      We cannot access, decrypt, or read them — only you can, using your password.</p>

      <p><strong>🔑 Password &amp; Biometric Security:</strong> 
      Your master password is used to derive encryption keys with PBKDF2 (65,536 iterations). 
      We never store or transmit it. Biometric unlock (fingerprint/face) is managed by Android’s secure Keystore system.</p>

      <p><strong>📴 Offline First:</strong> DataVault works offline by default. 
      No background upload, telemetry, or tracking occurs without user action.</p>

      <p><strong>🧾 Ads and Data Sharing:</strong> 
      Like Medical DICOM Viewer, DataVault uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. 
      AdMob may access approximate location, device identifiers, and app activity for personalized or non-personalized ad delivery. 
      Users can opt out of ad personalization via their device’s Google Account settings.</p>

      <p><strong>🗑️ Data Deletion:</strong> 
      You can delete all app data locally by clearing the app’s storage or uninstalling it. 
      To request deletion of analytics or ad-related data associated with your use, contact us via email at 
      <a href="mailto:wedevelopinpk@gmail.com">wedevelopinpk@gmail.com</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>🚫 No Password Recovery:</strong> For security reasons, lost passwords cannot be recovered. Keep your password safe — we cannot restore your vault.</p>

      <p><strong>🔒 Security Commitment:</strong> 
      We use industry-standard encryption and secure connections to protect your data. 
      However, users are responsible for managing their own passwords and backups.</p>

      <hr style="border-color:#444; margin:40px 0;">

      <h3>👶 Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>Our apps are not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.</p>

      <h3>🔁 Policy Updates</h3>
      <p>This policy may change as our apps evolve or as regulations require. 
      We will always post the latest version on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
