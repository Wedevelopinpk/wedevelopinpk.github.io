        <!-- Medical DICOM Viewer Privacy Policy -->
        <h3 style="color: #ffa500; font-weight: 600;">Medical DICOM Viewer</h3>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 8, 2025</p>
        <p>This policy outlines the privacy practices for the Medical DICOM Viewer application. Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
        <p><strong>üö´ No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or analytics. The app's functionality is designed to work without requiring personal data from you.</p>
        <p><strong>üìÅ Local File Access:</strong> The app requires access to your device's storage to open DICOM files, folders, or ZIP archives that you explicitly select. These files are processed directly on your device and are never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>
        <p><strong>‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive‚Ñ¢ Integration:</strong>
            <br>- <strong>Authentication:</strong> To access files from Google Drive, the app uses Google Sign-In for authentication. This process is handled securely by Google. We only receive basic account information (like your name and email) for display purposes within the app and do not store it.
            <br>- <strong>Permissions:</strong> The app requests <strong>read-only</strong> permission (`DriveScopes.DRIVE_READONLY`) for your Google Drive. This means the app can only view and download files you choose; it <strong>cannot</strong> create, modify, or delete any of your files.
            <br>- <strong>Temporary Cache:</strong> When you open files from Google Drive, they are downloaded to a secure, temporary cache folder within the app's private storage. This data is automatically deleted when you close the viewer screen. We do not have access to this data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>üí≥ Google Play Billing:</strong>
            <br>- <strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> The app uses the Google Play Billing service to manage one-time purchases for pro features.
            <br>- <strong>Payment Information:</strong> All transactions are processed securely by Google. We do not collect, see, or store any of your financial information, such as credit card numbers. We only receive a confirmation from Google that a purchase was successful.
        </p>
        <p><strong>üìú Policy Updates:</strong> We may occasionally update this policy to reflect app changes. Any modifications will be posted on this page.</p>
        <p>If you have questions, contact us at:<br>
          <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:wedevelopinpk@gmail.com">wedevelopinpk@gmail.com</a>

        <!-- DataVault Privacy Policy -->
        <h3 style="color: #ffa500; font-weight: 600;">DataVault</h3>
        <p><strong>DataVault</strong> is built to prioritize your privacy and give you full control over your personal data. This app is designed to operate fully offline, and no data is collected or tracked by us. However, if you choose to use the optional backup features, limited data transmission may occur as described below.</p>
        <p><strong>üõ°Ô∏è No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or analytics. We do not store your password, files, email, or any identifiers on our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>‚òÅÔ∏è Optional Backups:</strong> If you choose to use the optional backup feature, your encrypted data may be transmitted to a storage service of your choice (such as Google Drive or a local export). This process is entirely user-initiated. We do not have access to your files, encryption keys, or backup locations.</p>
        <p><strong>üîë Your Encryption, Your Control:</strong> All backed-up data remains encrypted with your master password. We cannot read, decrypt, or restore any of your content ‚Äî only you can do that using your password.</p>
        <p><strong>üì¥ Offline By Default:</strong> Unless you explicitly initiate a backup, DataVault functions entirely offline. No data leaves your device automatically.</p>
        <p><strong>‚ùå No Password Recovery:</strong> For your security, we cannot recover lost or forgotten passwords. Please store your password safely.</p>
        <p><strong>üîê Biometric Login:</strong> If you use fingerprint or facial recognition, that data is managed securely by your device's operating system. We never store or access biometric data.</p>
